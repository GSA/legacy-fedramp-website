## Initial Readiness Assessment Report Feedback

On March 28, 2016, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) posted a draft of the FedRAMP Readiness Assessment Report and FedRAMP Readiness Assessment Guidance for CSPs and 3PAOs for public comment and have heard from many of you. ** ** The goal of the FedRAMP Readiness Assessment Report is to allow vendors to demonstrate their capabilities faster through an assessment by a Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) than through documentation reviews by the FedRAMP PMO. This will in turn enable Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Agencies to achieve FedRAMP authorizations faster without negatively impacting risk and quality of security packages.

### Sunsetting CSP-Supplied with a Revamped FedRAMP Ready

On March 28th, the FedRAMP PMO announced that the CSP-Supplied option will evolve as part of an effort to focus on agency and JAB provisional authorizations. After numerous interviews with CSPs, agencies, and 3PAOs, we concluded that CSP-Supplied had the lowest demand and was too risky, costly, and resource intensive for both industry and the FedRAMP PMO.

### Reader Submission: 

**Project Hosts: A Small CSP Who Likes FedRAMP**

Project Hosts is a small business cloud service provider (CSP) that submitted its FedRAMP paperwork in** April, 2014 and achieved FedRAMP SaaS compliance in January, 2015.

I like FedRAMP.

Don’t get me wrong. The demanding standards, policies and processes required by FedRAMP are painful to implement. But it’s worth it.

### #Where's Ashley

It’s been a  great month working with multiple Agencies, CSPs, 3PAOs and the public as part of both the Agency Roadshow and #WheresAshley campaigns. In one day alone this month, I met with six CSPs working with Agencies and two Agency partners!

This month, I traveled to Austin, Texas, in collaboration with the Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) to participate in the Apps.gov launch at SXSW.  Apps.gov is a PIF initative to provide Agencies and one-stop shop to explore, compare and quickly evaluate SaaS proviers.  Check it out: [Apps.gov](https://apps.gov)
