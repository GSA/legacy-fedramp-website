<img class="alignright wp-image-25692 " src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/04/FedRAMP-TIC-Overlay-graphic-300x149.jpg" alt="FedRAMP-TIC Overlay graphic" width="352" height="175" srcset="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/04/FedRAMP-TIC-Overlay-graphic-300x149.jpg 300w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/04/FedRAMP-TIC-Overlay-graphic-1024x511.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 352px) 100vw, 352px" />The FedRAMP PMO and TIC Initiative are jointly requesting feedback on a DRAFT FedRAMP-Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) Overlay. This DRAFT overlay is the first step in updating TIC’s current reference architecture to allow for greater flexibility as agencies move to the cloud securely. The overlay will enable mobile users to directly connect to Federal cloud system without utilizing a TIC Access Provider (TICAP) or  Managed Trusted IP Service (MTIPS).

FedRAMP and TIC are seeking US Federal Departments and Agencies, CSPs, and other stakeholders to provide comments on this DRAFT overlay. The 30 day open comment period is from April 2, 2015 to May 1, 2015. All details about this request for feedback and documents to review are available at: [www.FedRAMP.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=18862).

The FedRAMP PMO is excited to announce the addition of three  accredited 3PAOs:

  * GMS Registrar Ltd
  * Lattimore, Black, Morgan, and Cain, P.C
  * MindPoint Group, LLC

A full listing of all FedRAMP accredited 3PAOs can be viewed [here](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=2022).

There’s no time like the present. While the requirement for notifying your FedRAMP ISSO on any significant change to your environment is at least 30 days, letting us know earlier rather than later of the potential change can help diffuse any questions and ensure the appropriate process is followed. Please keep in mind that a Significant Change Form (significant change as defined in the approved SSP), Security Impact Analysis, and appropriate supporting artifacts (if applicable: network topology, data-flow diagram, scan results, etc.) must be provided to your ISSO for review prior to implementing the change.  Your ISSO will review the proposed change for any impacts to your environment's security posture and determine next steps.

The Significant Change Form can be found here: <https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates-3/>**** ****
