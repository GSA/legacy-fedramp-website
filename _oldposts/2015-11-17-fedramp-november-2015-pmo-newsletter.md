## The Value of Quality Management

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) who incorporate Quality Management into their authorization package development projects will realize a return on their investment throughout the FedRAMP Review and Approve (R&A) process. Quality documentation is clear, concise, consistent, and complete. Quality documentation minimizes costly rework and time consuming delays caused by clarifying misunderstandings and waiting for missing documentation. FedRAMP requires quality documentation to provide a clear and complete description of the risk posture of a cloud system and reduce an agency’s level of effort to reuse an authorization package.

Since March 2014, [American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA)](https://www.a2la.org/) has been working diligently to transfer all FedRAMP Third Party Accredited Organizations (3PAOs) to the new recognition process, which starts with accreditation by A2LA to the international standard ISO/IEC 17020. The standard is written specifically for the accreditation of inspection bodies, such as 3PAOs. A2LA is a nonprofit accreditation body, with over 30 years of experience accrediting to ISO standards.
