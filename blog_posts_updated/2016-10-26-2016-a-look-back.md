This past year was extremely busy for the FedRAMP program with many exciting highlights. I'm so proud of all the hard work by the PMO team and our stakeholders to continue to advance this program, and I wanted to share some of the most notable accomplishments with you. Thank you all for your input and support. I look forward to an even more impressive FY17!
