While we are in the final days of receiving comments on our new Low Impact SaaS (LISaaS) baseline, **FedRAMP** **_Tailored_**, which was developed to support industry solutions that are low risk, and many times, low cost for agencies to deploy and use.

To ensure the **FedRAMP** **_Tailored_** baseline meets and exceeds our stakeholders’ needs, we are hosting a Comment-a-thon on April 18th to gather feedback. Our goal is to have agencies and vendors convene to review the baseline and provide feedback in a format that generates excitement and builds a sense of community. This will be a collaborative, enterprising, dynamic event to encourage ideation, networking, and feedback.

The Comment-a-thon will take place in D.C., with a virtual component available for those who cannot attend in-person:

**Date**: April 18th

**Time**: 12:00pm , 4:00pm

**In Person:** 1250 Connecticut Ave NW, Washington DC 20036

**Virtual**: Details will be sent via email.
