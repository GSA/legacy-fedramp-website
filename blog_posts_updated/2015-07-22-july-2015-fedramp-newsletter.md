## What is FedRAMP Ready?

“How do I become FedRAMP Ready?”

If you’re a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), then you might have asked this question. Or possibly you submitted this question to the PMO thinking FedRAMP Ready is a potential path to authorization. Becoming FedRAMP Ready is a key step in becoming FedRAMP compliant, but it is not a final determination. But if you plan on becoming FedRAMP compliant, then understanding the FedRAMP Ready designation is necessary. [Read the full story.](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=31722)

## INVITE: High Baseline Tiger Team

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is looking for Government volunteers to join the High Baseline Tiger Team. This team will adjudicate the public commentary received for the draft [High Baseline](https://www.fedramp.gov/provide-public-comment/fedramp-high-baseline/) in January 2015.

The Tiger Team will develop a series of recommendations for changes to the high baseline. The team’s focus will be to review all comments received during the public comment period. The Tiger Team will adjudicate the comments in preparation for a second round of public comment on the draft baseline. [_Read the full story._](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=32992)

## FedRAMP PMO releases three new documents

FedRAMP has released new three new documents which pertain to Federal agencies, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), and Third-Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs).

  * The [FedRAMP General Document Acceptance Criteria](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/07/FedRAMP-General-Document-Acceptance-Criteria.pdf) outlines the standards and quality which FedRAMP expects for all documents submitted to the program.
  * The [P-ATO Management and Revocation Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/07/FedRAMP-P-ATO-Management-and-Revocation-Guide-v1.0.pdf) lays out the escalation process and procedures FedRAMP will take when a CSPs fails to maintain the Continuous Monitoring requirements of a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO).
  * The [3PAO Obligations and Performance Guide](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/482/2015/07/3PAO-Obligations-and-Performance-Guide-v1.0.pdf) details how FedRAMP ensures all accredited 3PAOs are meeting the same quality, independence, and knowledge requirements.

All three documents are available on the [FedRAMP website](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/).

## FedRAMP 3PAO Requirements Webinar

The PMO hosted webinar on July 28th from 11 am to 12 pm EST on the [DRAFT FedRAMP 3PAO Accreditation Requirements](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=31242). If you missed the live webinar, you can listen to the recorded version on the [FedRAMP website](https://www.fedramp.gov/fedramp-webinars/).

FedRAMP is requesting feedback on an updated, DRAFT version of the 3PAO Accreditation Requirements. This DRAFT updates FedRAMP’s current 3PAO requirements which originated in 2010. As a growing program, FedRAMP has recognized the need to update these requirements to improve the quality of 3PAO assessment documentation, assessment team training, and oversight of accredited organizations. Once finalized, these requirements will be used by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditors (A2LA) to review 3PAO applicants and evaluate currently accredited 3PAOs for inclusion within the FedRAMP 3PAO Program. [Read the full public comment solicitation.](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=31242)
