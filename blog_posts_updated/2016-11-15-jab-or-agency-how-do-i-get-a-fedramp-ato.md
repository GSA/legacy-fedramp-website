*“Should a CSP pursue JAB or agency authorization?”* That is probably one of the most common questions the PMO receives. And most would be surprised by the answer: for a majority of providers, an agency authorization is the most appropriate route.

FedRAMP’s primary goal is to bring as many secure, multi-tenant, and unique cloud tools to the [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/index.html#/products). Both JAB and agency authorization receive a security assessment based upon a standardized set of requirements in accordance with FISMA using a baseline set of NIST 800-53 controls. This means JAB and agency authorizations should be secure and fit for federal data. But what about “necessary” and “unique”?

### Multi-Tenant

A cloud system that is multi-tenant in nature and has a broad use case of capabilities is exactly the kind of cloud that should pursue JAB authorization. The JAB reviews clouds that can and are being used government-wide. So if a CSP is considering JAB authorization, they should definitely take into consideration the amount of federal interest in their service and the depth of use cases across the government.

###  Unique

If only one or two agencies are interested in a CSP’s cloud product or the cloud was designed specifically for a particular agency, then agency authorization is a better fit. Agency authorizations are targeted for niche cloud services that may only be used by a singular agency. Clouds that are unique to a particular agency provide a great benefit to that agency, but is not a good option for JAB authorization.

However, this is what makes an agency authorization so valuable! Agencies are able to issue authorizations to cloud services on an as-needed basis. And once that service is listed as a [FedRAMP Authorized](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?status=Compliant&sort=productName) product, other agencies will also be able to leverage the provider’s niche service if another agency has a similar need.

The decision to pursue JAB or agency authorization depends on if the cloud is multi-tenant and has broad use across many agencies or if it is unique to a few. While there two routes to authorization, the end goal of JAB and agency authorizations are the same , increasing the amount of secure and diverse cloud products that are available to the federal government.
