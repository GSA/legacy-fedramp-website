We are excited to announce our release of the **_FedRAMP Tailored_** Baseline for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) with Low-Impact Software- as-a-Service (LI-SaaS) Systems!  FedRAMP Tailored was developed to support industry solutions that are low risk and low cost for agencies to deploy and use. Additionally, FedRAMP Tailored:

* Creates a faster, streamlined process for systems that are low risk for use like collaboration tools, project management applications, and tools that help develop open-source code

* Supports government Authorizing Officials’ need for a standardized approach to determining the risks associated with authorizing specific low-impact cloud applications

* Incorporates industry input in order to provide the government with the agility to leverage valuable industry services while maintaining appropriate security levels

We originally released [**_FedRAMP Tailored_**](https://www.fedramp.gov/launching-a-fedramp-tailored-baseline/) for public comment in February of this year. After making significant updates and incorporating your feedback, which included over 330 comments and reactions, we released it for a second public comment period in July. You can view all the comments and FedRAMP’s responses by visiting the GitHub [comment repository](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-tailored/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

We’ve published the final documents in the [Templates](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/templates-2016/) pages of our [website](https://www.fedramp.gov/), which can be located under the “Resources” section of our navigation menu.
